# Responsive-Portfolio
Rutgers Coding Boot Camp Responsive Portfolio Homework

## Discription 
This assignment was to test the ability to create a responsive web page using media tags and three different screen sizes. Using a pre-built starter code and the screen pixel widths of 980, 768, and 640, I was able to make this portfolio not only responsive, but clear and cohesive on different screens. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS
